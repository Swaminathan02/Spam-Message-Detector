# Spam-Message-Detector
Hello, I have made a Machine Learning Project using Logistic Regression 
It is used to detect the spam message 

In order to give the input,
  Type your message input on the 'custom_data' variable.
It outputs the message is 'Spam' or 'Ham'.

My project predicts the Spam messages with an Accuracy rate of 96.92%

Download the CSV file -> Get the location of the file -> And,
Add that location in the place of 'file' variable present in the spam-detection.ipynb file.
